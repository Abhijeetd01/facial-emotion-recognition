# Emotion Recognition using Deep Learning
A  recognition system through webcam streaming/image input and CNN.

## Abstraction
This project aims to recognize facial expression with CNN implemented by Keras. 
I also implement a real-time module which can real-time capture user's face through webcam steaming called by opencv. 
OpenCV cropped the face it detects from the original frames and resize the cropped images to 48x48 grayscale image, 
Then take them as inputs of deep leanring model. 

## Dataset
[fer2013](https://www.kaggle.com/c/challenges-in-representation-learning-facial-expression-recognition-challenge/data) is the dataset I chose, which is anounced in Kaggle competition in 2013.


### Requirements
NumPy
Tensorflow r1.1
Keras 2
OpenCV2

###Predict
